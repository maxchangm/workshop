  "description": "This diagram illustrates the architecture of a Transformer model, showing how input and output sequences are processed through stacked encoder and decoder blocks. Each block contains multi-head attention and feed-forward layers, with residual connections and layer normalization. The model uses positional encoding to handle sequence order and outputs predictions via a linear layer followed by softmax."
