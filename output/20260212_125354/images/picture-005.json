  "description": "The image displays a word alignment visualization, likely from a machine translation or language model analysis, showing how source words map to target words. It highlights the phrase “The Law will never be perfect” aligning with “its application should be just” in a target sentence. The visualization uses lines to indicate relationships between words, with a highlighted segment focusing on the alignment between “The Law” and “its application.”"
